# Docs Template for GovLab Project

The documentation content goes in the `_doc` folder, and can be broken down into several .md files, for easier maintenance.

Initailly I thought of breaking the .md files on the top level titles.

We still need a lot of improvements on the sidebar, to make it automatic.

Will add issues for that
