### History
This is the first instance of OD500 moved to jekyll. Uses the survey data for [Open Data 150 Canada](http://canada.opendata500.com/).

### Prerequisites
- [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)


### Getting Started

- Clone the repo: [OD500-jekyll](https://github.com/GovLab/od500-jekyll.git)

#### Installing

- Fetch and update bundled gems by running `bundle install`
- Fetch and update npm packages by running `npm install`

#### Development
- Run the server with `bundle exec jekyll serve`. Your server will run at [http://localhost:4000/](http://localhost:4000/)
- You can also use gulp to live reloading via browsersync. `gulp` will run at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). **Needs Work** 
  
### Deployment

Run `gulp deploy` to deploy to GitHub Pages.

We use [gulp-gh-pages](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-gh-pages) to publish the site to [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). The deploy task is defined in the [gulpfile](https://github.com/GovLab/od500-jekyll/blob/master/gulpfile.js), which pushes the compiled _site folder to the gh-pages branch.

### API
All company and sunburst data is delivered via the [OD500 API](https://github.com/GovLab/od500-api), which is built on top of [Sinatra](https://github.com/sinatra/sinatra), [Grape](https://github.com/ruby-grape/grape), and [Mongoid](https://github.com/mongodb/mongoid).

### Sunburst
The endpoint for the sunburst data is `http://api.opendata500.com/api/v1/sunburst/Canada`. The data needs to be formatted hierarchically:

Agency Type --> Agency --> Companies using agency data

``` json
{
  "name": "OD500_PROJECT_NAME",
  "total_companies": "NUMBER_OF_COMPANIES_SURVEYED",
  "total agencies": "NUMBER_OF_DATA_SOURCES",
  "children": [{
    "name": "FEDERAL",
    "children": [{
      "name": "FEDERAL_AGENCY_1",
      "children": [{
        "name": "COMPANY_NAME",
        "companyCategory": "COMPANY_CATEGORY",
        "companyType": "COMPANY_TYPE",
        "companyCity": "COMPANY_CITY",
        "country": "COMPANY_COUNTRY",
        "yearFounded": "YEAR FOUNDED",
        "businessModel": ["BUSINESS_MODEL_1"],
        "state": "COMPANY_STATE"
      }]
    }]
  }, {
    "name": "PROVINCIAL",
    "children": [{
      "name": "PROVINCIAL_AGENCY_1",
      "children": [{
        "name": "COMPANY_NAME",
        "companyCategory": "COMPANY_CATEGORY",
        "companyType": "COMPANY_TYPE",
        "companyCity": "COMPANY_CITY",
        "country": "COMPANY_COUNTRY",
        "yearFounded": "YEAR FOUNDED",
        "businessModel": ["BUSINESS_MODEL_1"],
        "state": "COMPANY_STATE"
      }]
    }]
  }]
}
```

### Map
The endpoint for the map data is `http://api.opendata500.com/api/v1/map/Canada`. The map is also used to filter the list data by province/region.


### Company List
The list page uses [List.js](http://listjs.com/) for table sorting, dropdown and map filtering, and fuzzy searching on specific fields.


### Plugins

#### [jekyll-get](https://github.com/18F/jekyll-get) 
Retrieves data from the API. The existing config pulls data from the Canada companies API and saves it to `_data/companies.json`.

In `_config.yml`:

``` yaml
jekyll_get:
  - data: companies
    json: 'https://od500-api.herokuapp.com/api/v1/results/Canada'
    cache: true
```

#### [jekyll-multiple-languages-plugin](https://github.com/Anthony-Gaudino/jekyll-multiple-languages-plugin)
An internationalization plugin that builds the site in multiple languages. Translations are found in the `_i18n` folder.

#### [jekyll-datapage-gen](https://github.com/avillafiorita/jekyll-datapage_gen)
Creates a page for each company in `_data/companies.json` using the `company_name_id` field.

In `_config.yml`:

``` yaml
page_gen:
  - data: companies
    name: company_name_id
    template: company-page
```

#### Custom
Since the data comes to us from multiple countries, using multiple survey methods, the data that comes back often needs a lot of custom filters to get them into a readable format. The `_plugins/data_formatter.rb` file contains custom methods for each survey instance.
